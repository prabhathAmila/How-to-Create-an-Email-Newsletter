# How to Create an Email Newsletter
Create the best email newsletter for your business or personal goals.

Email isn’t going away. It’s here to stay. In the same vein, email newsletters are becoming more popular (and more important) than ever.

If you want to reach potential (and existing) customers, newsletters are a great way to spread your message to a large audience — whether it be upcoming projects, company news, or other business-related information.

In this tutorial, going to walk you through how to create an email newsletter template in Adobe Photoshop, and we’re going to be using some common design patterns that I’ve found very effective.

After you’ve completed the design process, you’ll be ready to code and style this newsletter template for your business.

# What Exactly Is an Email Newsletter?
You’ve probably seen an email newsletter in your inbox before. It’s a cost-effective way for brands to communicate with their users or customers.

If you’re a content site, your newsletter includes an enticing headline for each new article to get users to click over to your site and read more.

As long as you’re offering content that your customers or users find useful, you can leverage email newsletters to keep your brand fresh in their minds.

## The Purpose of an Email Newsletter
	The purpose of an email newsletter depends on your business. You can use it to drive sales through featured products and coupons. You can connect with customers through helpful tips and information. You can even boost your social following or traffic to your site.
	
	Just remember, good email campaigns are tailored to your needs as well as to the needs of your users.

## How Do Email Newsletters Work?
	A good email newsletter is not an update of company news. It’s a way to engage people and get them to take an action. It offers readers exclusive information they could not get anywhere else and then calls on them to click, buy or subscribe.
	
	To do that, your newsletter format should be simple and easy to read, yet attention-grabbing.

# Set your email newsletter size
	Unfortunately, email newsletters don't size themselves when you send them to subscribers. But because everyone opens their email on their device and email service of choice, how are you supposed to know what size or resolution they should be?
	
	Most providers will default your email newsletter size to 600px wide, with email body padding another 30px wide on all sides. And when this happens, the content inside your newsletter might not survive the adjustment. Therefore, it's important to ensure your newsletter design fits inside that universal 600px width.
	
	What about height? Ultimately, your email can be as high (or, rather, as long) as you want it to be without the email client distorting its design. However, people are much less likely to click through to your website if the email goes on forever -- and email clients with sensitive spam filters might take notice as well. As a general rule, try not to make your email recipients scroll for more than a second before reaching the end of it.

# Add in your body content
	filling in the template with words and pictures. This will be the meat of your email newsletter, so spend time perfecting it. Most people keep the copy short and sweet to encourage clickthroughs, though some notable newsletter take the opposite approach.
	
	Be sure to add in some images if they can help support your copy.
	
	Don't forget to edit your email thoroughly -- maybe even send it on to one of your teammates for a once-over. Remember, once you send the thing, you can't fix those embarrassing typos like you can with web content.
	
# Add in personalization tokens and smart content
	
	If you want your newsletters to feel that personal, you should do three things:	
		1. Segment your emails and choose content that group of people will love.
		
		2. Add in personalization tokens. If your marketing software supports personalization, this is a really easy thing to implement that could have big results for your conversion rates. That being said, only add in a few personalization tokens -- you don't want to creep out your email recipients.
		
		3. Also add in smart content. This is content that shows one thing to one part of your audience and one thing to another. An example would be a Smart CTA -- your leads would see a CTA for talking to your sales reps and your customers would see one about getting tickets to a customer-only event. Neither audience would want to see the other audience's CTA, so smart content will show only the right CTA to the right person.

	* Choose your subject line and sender name.
	* Add social media share icons


	Your audience may like different things, but we've found that having a sender name from a real person increased opens and clickthroughs. Try running an A/B test to see if it works for you, too. Whatever you choose, make sure it's something recognizable so recipients aren't confused as to why they're receiving your email.
	
	Subject lines are a little trickier. Lots of things can help you put together a click-worthy subject line, including brevity and an immediately actionable value proposition. That being said, some really great marketing emails have been sent with the subject "Hey." Use the subject line best practices as a jumping-off point, then run your own A/B tests to see what your audience loves.

	
# Support your newsletter content with alt text and plain text
	At this point, you'll have the email pretty much ready to go. While going through the steps above, I'm guessing you forgot two absolutely crucial things (I know I forget them almost every time I make an email): the alt text and plain text.
	
	Alt text is the text that appears when a picture isn't loaded. Since not all email providers load images properly, you have to make sure the alt text is there so your recipients know what they're looking at. If you're including a CTA that's an image, your conversion rates will definitely suffer without alt text.
	
	Some email clients also won't display HTML properly, which is why you need to make sure your emails look great in plain text. Make sure the links are easy to click and that it's clear what the email is about without the photos.

# Test different browsers and email providers.
	
	Email providers don't all read email code the same way -- what looks fine on Gmail in Chrome will look terrible in Outlook, for example. So you need to test out emails in the most popular browsers and email providers.
	
	If you have HubSpot, you can test emails for different providers in the tool. If you don't, check out Litmus, or create a bunch of fake email accounts and test everything manually.
